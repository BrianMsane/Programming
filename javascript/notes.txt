The key concepts you need to understand in javascript

Guidelines
===============
i. camel case naming convention (firstName as opposed to snake case first_name)
ii. comments are more like C++ comments[// and /**/]
iii. naming rules for variables are still the same with Python

Rules for naming variables
==================
1. Do not use keywords
2. Be descriptive
3. Must be alpha-numeric(start with an alphabet before any number)
4. No spaces between words but stick to the camel case naming convention


1. variables(const[constant which never changes once defined], var[overidable], let)
2. data types and data structures(string, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects, JSON)
3. functions(traditional functions vs arrow functions() => {})
4. Interacting with HTML and CSS. (DOM manipulation)
5. Operators(comparison(===, !==), assignment, arithmentic and so on)
6. String manipulation (use the methods defined for the string class call using the dot operator)
7. Control flow (if, else if, else, and switch statements)
8. Classes and OOP
